## Introduction
Grandma's Recipes and Others is a web application that provides a recipe search system, allowing users to explore various recipes. The project is implemented as part of an Internet development environments course project.

## Project Phases
The project is divided into three phases:

1. **API Document Writing (Work 3.1):** In this phase, an API document is created, defining the contract between the server and the client. Server-side and client-side responsibilities are specified based on the initial Product Requirements Document (PRD).

2. **Backend Implementation (Work 3.2):** The server (Node.js + Express.js) and the database (MySQL) are implemented in this phase. The backend responds to the API defined in the API document, and an external API is used for recipe search and related details.

3. **Frontend Implementation (Work 3.3):** In this phase, the client side (JS.VUE) is implemented. The frontend communicates with the backend through the API and provides various features like recipe details, preparation instructions, and a personal area for saving family recipes.

## Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies for the backend and frontend.
3. Set up the database (MySQL) with the provided schema.
4. Start the backend server.
5. Start the frontend application.

## API Document
The API document outlines the contract between the server and the client. It specifies the resources exposed by the server, how they should be accessed/requested, and how the server responds. Any changes made to the API during the project must be documented.

## Backend Implementation
The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js. It handles the API requests, interacts with the MySQL database, and provides data to the frontend application. Additionally, it utilizes an external API for recipe search functionality.

## Frontend Implementation
The frontend is developed using JS.VUE. It communicates with the backend through the defined API, displaying recipe details, preparation instructions, and other relevant information to the users.

## Navigation Bar
The application features a navigation bar with different tabs for different user roles: everyone, offline user, and logged-in user. The tabs display links to various pages, including the main page, search page, about page, login page, registration page, personal area, and new recipe creation page.

## About Page
The About page contains a marketing brief on the development team and the project, along with links to previous exercises and relevant resources.

## Usage
After setting up the project locally, you can access the web application in your browser. The navigation bar will provide access to different pages based on the user role (guest, offline user, logged-in user).
